# simple-service

Just a simple API to test the IBM Cloud as a continuous delivery process.

## Setup

I used the [node-pong] module to just start a quick listening api endpoint for testing purposes. It provides default "/ping" endpoint on defined ports.

The array of listening ports:

```json
["8080", "13420", "4500", "4600-4602"]
```
